=== The Possibilities are endless ===

Upcoming versions of the plugin will enable you, the plugin user, to leverage the power of the entire JG Spam Fighter user community. Every time a user, such as you, blocks an IP address and removes the spammy comments (that's all accomplished by a single click in the plugin), the spammy IP address will be [reported](https://blacklisted.gauracreative.com). As the [database of spammy IP addresses](https://blacklisted.gauracreative.com) grows new features will soon be available, based on that collected user input. For example, you may be able to have spammy comments automatically removed and even outright blocked based on some user-defined conditional settings. Say, if an IP address has been reported by other users 100 times, go ahead and block it on my site too. As the developer I am open to your input here! The possibilities are endless! Please feel free to [contact me](https://blacklisted.gauracreative.com/contact) with any ideas and functionality requests.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/jg_spam_fighter` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

= What is JG Spam Fighter? =

JG Spam Fighter is a simple to use WordPress plugin that enables you to leverage the power of the user community and keep your WordPress site clean of spam comments.

= How does JG Spam Fighter Work? =

When someone makes a comment on your blog the Wordpress takes a note of the IP (computer) address from which the comment was made. Spammers, whether robots or real persons, usually make more than one comment from one such IP address. More like dozens if not hundreds of them. Based on the above JG Spam Fighter Plugin makes it easy for you to identify and remove spammy comments in bulk AND block the spammy IP addresses as well, to prevent further spam.

== Screenshots ==

1. The main interface.
1. Hover your mouse over an IP address and you will see a couple of options.
1. Click on "samples" option and you will see sample comments from the IP address. You should be able to easily tell if those are spam. Then you can remove them and block the IP address to prevent it from further spamming your blog.
